        <div class="lesson-page-contents">
            <p>One of the most exploited vulnerabilities of SQL databases is an attack known as SQL Injection</p>

            <p>This technique user inputs that hve not been properly verified before being sent back to the server</p>

            <p>The best way to prevent an application from being vulnerable to SQL Injection is to Sanitize any user
                inputs, both on the front-end and the back-end</p>

            <p>User's have permission to conduct SQL Injection attacks on this application, but bear in mind that using
                this technique in the wild is almost always illegal</p>

            <p>SQL Injection attacks are performed by treating User Input as part of an SQL statement</p>

            <p>Users add small bits of SQL code to their inputs while monitoring the results</p>

            <p>Through this simple method, the attacker can learn what implementation of SQL is being used</p>

            <p>The consequences of such an attack can be huge, and attackers can potentially use unsanitized inputs to
                gain access to sensitive data and potentially to the server the application is running on</p>

            <p>An SQL Injection Attack can be performed by manipulating a SELECT query and making it return True no
                matter what condition was</p>

            <p>A simple SQL Injection Attack usually takes the following form:</p>

            <p class="lesson-page-example"> SELECT FROM dbTable WHERE key=0 OR 1=1 </p>

            <p>The example above has a condition, WHERE key=0 or 1=1. Since 1=1 is always true, the database will return
                each row in the table</p>

            How does it work?
        </h2>

        <div class="lesson-page-contents">
            <p>Here we have 2 input fields that are sent to the back-end before being used to construct a SQL query</p>

            <p>The SQL database in this scenario has a table containing sensitive information such as ids and credit
                card numbers</p>

            <p>When the form is submitted the following query is created</p>

            <p class="lesson-page-example">"select * from user_data where Login_Count = " + Login_Count + " and USERID =
                " + User_ID;</p>

            <p>The Goal of this exercise is to manipulate one of the Queries to acquire all of the sensitive information
                in the database</p>

            <p>Entering a 1 in both boxes to return the first entry in the table, but that will not fulfill the goal</p>

            <p>To complete the task, the user must input a value that would make the query ALWAYS true</p>

            <p>If you need an example of a query that can ALWAYS return true, please refer to the previous page</p>
